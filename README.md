R data package of county occurrence data for U.S. Endangered Species Act-listed species.

### Source information

County occurrence data for U.S. Endangered Species Act-listed species based on the records in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's [ECOS website](http://ecos.fws.gov). This data set was subject to extensive manual curation to resolve incomplete and missing data. Until more refined range / occupancy information is made available, county-level resolution is the best we can get.
